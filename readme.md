# üåçThis is my website powered by Django.
It allows you to make an account(give any information about yourself, set avatar).\
Also you are allowed to make posts, modify them(if you are the creator of the one) and leave comments.\
Additionally you can create an event(reminder), setting up a date, time, text and urgency(urgency is displayed by color of the event).\
Aside from navigation bar, main menu will help you navigate through the site.\
**The section gallery is yet to be developed and implemented, the previous logic and code are _deprecated_ !**
## NOTICE:warning::
1) To be able to register on the website via email(standard way), you need to have a SMTP credentials set(login, password, secret_key), (for testing you can create a user with console or database)\
2) To be able to register on the websiter via VK you need to register an app in VK itself, type in your client_id(see more in main_menu/views.py), for more visit: https://dev.vk.com/ru/vkid/create-application.
